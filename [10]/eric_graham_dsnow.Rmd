# IDE: Integrated Development Environment

### What is an IDE?

* Combine code editor with tools for tools to support software development
* So many cool tools!
* Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code, and Pycharm are available for Linux, Mac, and Windows

### Public service announcments

* Professors will have requirements and preferences
* AI code assistants are not a substitute for knowing what to do
* Follow installation instructions, do your research! 
  * Especially if you're on Windows!!!

## Linting, Code Completion, and AI Code Assistants

* Code linting highlights errors and style issues
* Code completion is auto-complete for coding
* AI code assistants are specialized LLMs (can generate code and answer questions)

## Virtual Environments and Package Management

* Virtual environments are isolated installations of Python and packages
* Help prevent conflicts between packages and preserves the global local environment
* Tools like Conda and VENV create and manage virtual environments

## Jupyter Notebooks

* Wide adoption for data science
  * Powers Kaggle and Google Colab
* Can be used for Python or R
* Utilizes .ipynb files
  * Runs local web server, easily accessed through browser
  * Notebook files are also supported by other IDEs
* Commonly installed with Anaconda or Miniconda distribution

## Jupyter Pros and Cons

### Pros

* Combines markdown cells and code chunks
* Easy to share, reproducible research!
* Easy to set up and get coding

### Cons

* Doesn't scale well
  * Less suited to OOP, modularity, code re-use
* Less performant with large datasets
* No linting or code completion in web client

## Visual Studio Code

* Not to be confused with Visual Studio!
* Microsoft
* More traditional IDE than Jupyter

![Extension marketplace](dsnow_02_02.png)

## VS Code Pros and Cons

### Pros

* Multi-language
* Well supported
  * Extensions for everything, excellent Python linting support
* Tight integration with Github, profile sync
  * Optimized for Github Copilot, which students can get for free!

### Cons

* Learning curve to optimize settings and set up extensions for your workflow
* Can get bloated with extensions
* Jack of all trades, master of none?
* I don't like the Jupyter Notebook interface, but others do

## JetBrains Pycharm

* Also a traditional IDE
* Made for Python but also supports R
* As students, we can get the pro version of all JetBrains IDEs for free!
  * JetBrains' proprietary AI code assistant is not free
  * Plugin support for Github Copilot

## Pycharm Pros and Cons

### Pros

* Project management and virtual environment/package management
* Very strong code completion
* Excellent Jupyter notebook integration
* Built for Python, great support for DS workflows out of the box

### Cons

* Resource-intensive
* Learning curve
* Cadillac Escalade of Python IDEs
